The following code pattern requires the following infrastructure:
* A LinuxONE or Linux on IBM Z Virtual Machine
* A Canonical Ubuntu 16.04.LTS Linux Virtual Machine

# About Pervasive Encryption on LinuxONE
Pervasive encryption is a data-centric approach to information security that entails protecting data entering and exiting the z14 platform. It involves encrypting data in-flight and at-rest to meet complex compliance mandates and reduce the risks and financial losses of a data breach. It is a paradigm shift from selective encryption (where only the data that is required to achieve compliance is encrypted) to pervasive encryption. Pervasive encryption with z14 is enabled through tight platform integration that includes Linux on IBM Z or LinuxONE following features:
* Integrated cryptographic hardware: Central Processor Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF) is a co-processor on every processor unit that accelerates encryption. Crypto Express features can be used as hardware security modules (HSMs).
* Data set and file encryption: You can protect Linux file systems that is transparent to applications and databases.
* Network encryption: You can protect network data traffic by using standards-based encryption from endpoint to endpoint.

## LinuxONE Crypto Stack
Pervasive Encryption benefits of the full Power of Linux Ecosystem plus z14 Capabilities
* LUKS dm-crypt – Transparent file & volume encryption using industry unique CPACF protected-keys
* Network Security – Enterprise scale encryption and handshakes using z14 CPACF and SIMD (openSSL, IPSec...)

The IBM Z and LinuxONE systems provide cryptographic functions that, from an application program perspective, can be grouped as follows:
* Synchronous cryptographic functions, provided by the CP Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF) or the Crypto Express features when defined as an accelerator.
* Asynchronous cryptographic functions, provided by the Crypto Express features.

The IBM Z and LinuxONE systems provide also rich cryptographic functions available via a complete crypto stack made of a set of key crypto APIs.

**Note:** Locate openSSL and dm-crypt. For the following, we will work on how set-up a Linux environment in order to benefit of Pervasive Encryption benefits.
